How much time did you spend on the assignment?
    I spent around 6-9 hrs on the project in total.

What kind of challenges did you face?
    I was having a hard time understanding the Knuth's sequence, so I went to the following
    link : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33339851/how-is-the-knuth-sequence-properly-implemented-for-a-shellsort-in-java
    and it simplified it for me allowing me to move forward. I also struggled with timing the execution so
    I also found this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/180158/how-do-i-time-a-methods-execution-in-java
    that helped me use accomplish that.

 What are some things you did well?
    I think I was able to implement the algorithm well after understanding the sequence.

 If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    I would've started earlier and inquired about shellsort more to the professor.
